# Deep Learning- Image-Recognition
## Overview
This assignment focuses on building and experimenting with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for a real-world problem: facial recognition. The main goal is to implement a one-shot learning solution using CNNs, allowing the network to identify whether two facial images belong to the same person with minimal training data. This approach is inspired by the "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" paper.
